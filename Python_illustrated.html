<h3 id="_the_really_strange_introduction">The really strange introduction</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Once upon a time there were individuals who intentionally put the grass seeds
to the soil with anticipation of solving their nutrition problems. Or they
maybe only played with seeds and noticed what happened&#8230; Some years later,
people chew pizza made of flour, enjoying their holiday in Italy, thinking of
nothing&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;definitely not about the grass seeds that were put to the soil.
Still, the local bakers strive for perfection in baking <em>The Best Pizza in
The World</em>, choosing carefully the kind of flour.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Another time, another places, there were individuals that played with first
computers. They knew <em>everything</em> about their computer&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;till the last
bit. (Frankly, it was <em>a bit easier</em> as there was not so much bits inside
as they are now.) Often, they built the computer. Or at least they fell in love
with it and knew how to build it (also in cases when they bought it), and they
replayed in their imagination "how they are rebuilding the same",
feeling themselves strong, self-confident in the area. They knew "much
more" about "much less" in comparison with our present time.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>"Keep the ballance." The greatly admired people are often extreme
people. They often brought us something very valuable, but they were not
understood in their time, and they often <em>died poor</em> or in physical or in
mental sense. In other words, being odd makes it sometimes easier to be great
in something. The question is whether you want that. On the other hand,
focusing on being intentionally dumb in the chosen area to keep the statistic
ballance inside the society and expecting to be automatically successful in the
other areas&#8230; Well, it simply does not work.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>"Why the hell is he writing such obvious things?" This is called a
professional blindness. When focused on our professional problems, we often
behave strangely. Programming is no exception. Experts often think about the
users as about dumbs because the users cannot do <em>such obvious things</em>.
And the pizza chewers complain like "Why the application is so complicated
and still it does not do that one simple thing that I want?" And there are
also people, who simply want to try programming to have some fun.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The very basic things should never be underestimated or postponed for learning
later. It is no accident to call such things <em>Basic Building Blocks</em> of
programming. You can put something that works when interconnecting several
ready-to-be-used, bigger building blocks. However, it will not make you
universal. This will not help you to approach any general problem that could be
solved.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>"One picture is worth of thousands word." Well, it depends. The truth
is that "images" and "imagination" clearly have some common
base. Good imaginagion is one of the key abilities of a successful programmer.
In my opinion, this is the direction in which the beginners should be trained.
Too many teachers are not aware of that. They may think that it is obvious and
the students should already know that. The truth is that not all students are
of that kind to naturally feel the same. Also, I may be wrong. Anyway, I am
going to focuse on helping your imagination with images when explaining the
basic building blocks of the Python programming language. The following serie
(with at least one part ;) will show if the idea is good or not&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;just react
after reading the article.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>"Stop writing when it is good enough. It will never be perfect."
 This is one of the golden rules.  Another one says: "Never say
never."  A kind of paradox?  Maybe.  I will try to put both
together.  Based on your reactions to the specific parts, I will try to
simplify or explain better the basics to that level (from different angles of
view) that you will find nothing else to ask.  (Just kidding.
 Everything can be improved.) If you like mathematical or otherwise formal
approach to programming, you may not like the article.  I will try to
avoid mathematics and formalism&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;not because I do not like it, but because
beginners usually do not like it, and because it does not help to train in
imagination if you have a poor one (no offense meant, no shame).</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The reality does not need objects.
It is our perception that tries to recognize the object.  It is our
brain that is not capable to capture the reality as collection of all
recognizable and possibly interrelated details.  Our brain needs simplification
when thinking about complex things.  The caveman&#8217;s brain also needed that.
 What is <em>tangible</em> is more understandable.  "Give me that

good from a pedagogical point of view.  And you are capable of abstract
thinking, right?</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Let&#8217;s start with <em>variables</em> that are a kind of simplest version of
objects in any programming language.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_variables">Variables</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Even if you do not like the mathematical approach to programming, you should be
aware of the fact that the name <em>variables</em> comes from mathematics.
You know them from school as <em>letters</em> that are used to replace <em>any</em>
number.  You have learned how to search for their values if they were part
of what we call equations.  And you have learned how to manipulate
symbolically the formulas so that you could get simpler formulas.  To
summarize, the variables in mathematics are used as symbolic replacements for
the possible values.</p></div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/varM.png" alt="Mathematical formalism and variables." />
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Now the computer-related point of view.  Any value in computers
need some memory space to be stored.  One have to reserve certain amount
of bytes&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;the "bigger" value, the more bytes.  So, from the
hardware point of view, the variable is the memory space of some size placed
somewhere.  We have to know where the "where" is, and we (as
humankind) decided to number the memory positions, and we name the numbers as
the addresses.  The hardware does not need any "names" for
variables.  The size and the placement in memory is all the processor
needs to know when working with the content.</p></div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/varC.png" alt="Hardware-oriented view to variables." />
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Humans are more error prone when working with numbers (unless the
number means the sallary, or the pocket money, or the number of beers, or
similar counting cases that are so obvious to know them right).  When
programming, we combine the mathematical thinking with the computer-related
point of view.  We think in terms of memory space, but we do not like to
use the numeric address when thinking about the placement of that space.
 It would be too much details, and our brain would defend the situation
using the "forget it" mechanism.  The name for the space
(instead of the numeric address) is much more acceptable.  Our lazy brain
likes abstractions.  It does not like details, it likes working with fuzzy
pictures generated by our imagination.  The brain likes to search for the
principles of the solution of the problem.  When programming, we try to
automatize the steps leading to the solution.  Or we need to repeat the
same steps many times in future (for a different input to get the wanted
output), or we need to utilize the raw speed of the computer hardware and the
ability to remember, to organize and to work with many boring details.</p></div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/varA.png" alt="Mind picture of variables." />
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Programming
languages are here to put the humans (who design the way to get the solution)
and the computers together.  A programming language is used for
transformation of our abstract mental pictures of the solution to the form of a
formal description of steps leading to the solution (for a computer).
 Having that function, our favourite programming language must be capable
to describe the abstractions that were born in our brain.  But also the
reverse direction works: our favourite programming language uses constructions
and data abstractions that form the abstract thinking.  We gradually tend
to use the programming-language abstractions as basic blocks for our
imagination.  In other words, we learn <em>how to program in the
programming language</em>.  This is one of the main reasons why we have to
deeply understand the basic blocks of the programming language.  We have
to make the related abstract basic block for our thinking.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Back to variables. Let&#8217;s agree that our mind picture and the programming language
abstraction of a "variable" have the common features: 1) they can be
represented by the name, 2) they are capable to store the value.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The programming languages introduced several ways how to put the name of the
variable (called the <em>identifier</em> of the variable) with the related memory
space.  We use the variable names in our "program sources" which
are basically text files that are later compiled somehow to something more
acceptable by the computer hardware (to be executed as steps towards the
solution).</p></div>

<h3 id="_less_strange_but_still_introduction">Less strange, but still introduction</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The earlier title of this series was <em>Python Basics&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;Illustrated`.
And there were (fair) complaints that these are on _basics</em> of the language.
is introduction was added (1st August, 2011) to reflect some reactions.
As any other word, the word <em>basics</em> is a symbol with some meaning attached
to the word by some agreement.  Still, we always have to think in some context to understand
the agreement.  You may say that what is described in this and previous
articles is not related to <em>Python basics</em> at all.  It could be
because you expect a text written in some context that you met when reading
some other <em>basics</em>.  The article series could be renamed to <em>Python
foundation</em> or <em>Python internals</em>.  However, the later terms are <em>more
technical</em>, and I do not think it would help you to understand what I want
to write about.  Instead, I am asking you to change the context of
thinking about it.  Tutorials often start with the simplest example that
shows a working program (say "Hello, World!"&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;it is also a kind of
unspoken agreement bound to the "creation of a tutorial").  This
is understandable.  There are many ways of how to attract a beginner&#8217;s
attention.  The context of "basics" in this series is based on
"what you should know to understand".  I am focusing on
"mental pictures of what is done" rather than on "how to write
the block of code".  For that, I need also the text of this second
part.  I am aware of the situation that you may want to skip these two
articles with disagreement. ("Not related to Python at all!")
In the same time I believe, that the information will be useful for those
who find some knowledge gaps when reading the next <a href="#part3">part 3</a>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The previous <a href="#part1">part 1</a>
explained where the term "variable" came from, how we can think about
it, what it represents, how the variables are related to mathematics on one
side, and to computers on the other side.  This part (2) is focused on
more details that you have to understand if you really want to be good in
thinking about variables (creating a mental picture) and about using them in
programming languages.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>For explaining principles of working with variables, we need some excursion
outside the Python point of view.  This part describes variables in
context of traditional compiled languages to show some details.  Let&#8217;s
talk about pointers and references.  Good understanding will be necessary
to swallow the part 3.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_variables_in_the_old_compiled_languages">Variables in the (old) compiled languages</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Let&#8217;s think about the equation <code>a + b = 5</code> as about the Boolean expression
that returns&#8212;for the given content of variables <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>--the
Boolean value that indicates whether the values are the solution for the
equation.</p></div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/compiledVariables.png" alt="Compiled variables loose their names." />
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This is a fragment of a source code in the C language.
 The "C" is not important here.  Let it simply be the
example of a classical procedural compiled language.  In such case, the
source text is converted to the machine code via a compiler and a linker. The <em>names</em>
of the variables are totally replaced by addresses, by register names/numbers,
or the values are optimized to be the parts of the generated machine
instructions.  There is no trace of strings like <code>"a"</code>,
<code>"b"</code>, or <code>"result"</code> in the generated executable.  The
only exception is when you generate so called <em>debug</em> version of the executable
and you explicitly tell the compiler to remember the original names from the
source code; however, the computer does not need that.  Only the human,
the programmer wants the names be present in the debug info to make the
compiled code more readable when debugging.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>From that point of view, <em>a name of a variable to a human programmer</em> is
in the similar relation as <em>an address of a memory space to a processor</em>.
The name of the variable is <em>directly bound to the address</em>.  Or YOU
work with the name as with the string (in the source code) or the COMPILER
works with the address that is the result of the compilation of the name of the
variable (in the binary, executable code).</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_technical_representation_of_a_variable">Technical representation of a variable</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Technically, the variable needs the memory space and the identification to be
useful for a program.  The identification without the memory space makes
no sense&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;one cannot store anything inside.  The memory space without
the identification is useless either&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;one cannot access the memory space.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>We were speaking about <em>variables</em> in the previous part.  However,
the same holds for objects, i.e. for the memory space that is used to store the
data of the object.  Better to say, anything in Python is an object that
can be identified, including the things that are called variables in some
languages.  But stay tuned, the details will be explained later.  The
topic is not that easy as you may think at first. (There are more situations
like that. Say, the <em>strings</em>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;the topic "well known from the time
of written history". Or not? See <a href="http://diveintopython3.org/strings.html">http://diveintopython3.org/strings.html</a>).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The memory address serves as a good technical identifier.  It is
unambiguous. Moreover, you need no transformation to get the information where
the memory is located. The major Python implementations also take that approach&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;the address is equal to the technical identification of any variable (or of
any object).  Having any object &lt;b&gt;obj&lt;/b&gt; in Python, you can apply the
built-in function &lt;b&gt;id(obj)&lt;/b&gt; to get the identification.  (However,
other Python implementations are free to use a different kind of identification
in future. Think about a distributed computing environment where there is no
single, shared memory address space. The address is ambiguous in such systems
unless it is extended by some extra information about the location of the
memory/computer.)</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>What about the size of the reserved memory space?  When you need to store
a Boolean value, one bit would be enough.  As you cannot address one
single bit, the smallest possible piece of memory, one byte, is often used.
 If you want to store an integer, you usually think about 4 or more bytes.
 It depends on the programming language, on the compiler, and also on the
hardware. (In Python, integer variables are not that limited.  The space
for one integer value may vary depending on the actual value.)</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>To summarize, the memory space depends on the type of the value and sometimes
also on the actual value (think about a string of a different length in
whatever language].  In compiled languages, the size of trivial types is
known.  Therefore, the size of memory is related to the type.
 However, the information about the type is used/processed only during the
compilation.  Similarly to variable names, the type is used only to check
statically if the things are done in a correct way.  During the
compilation, the type-name information is lost, and the related size of memory
is present as numbers in the executable.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_where_the_memory_space_is_located">Where the memory space is located?</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Think about a simple situation.  You have a normal computer with one
processor and with one RAM (Random Access Memory).  The RAM address goes
(for simplicity) from zero to 4.000.000.000.  The variable needs say eight
bytes.  Where the eight bytes are to be located?</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>"I don&#8217;t care."  And you are right.  The machine and the
compiler should care.  Anyway, the code needs to know the location.
 Where the knowledge about the location is stored?</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The <em>compiled-language sources</em> are processed by the compilers that
consume the source texts and convert them to the machine code.  In such
case, the knowledge about the location must be hidden somewhere in the code.
Otherwise the code would not be able to access that portion of memory
(i.e. what once was the name of the variable).  In the case, <em>the
address</em> of the memory must be hidden in the code.  But how?</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Roughly said (i do not want to go into too much details):</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
The address can be a constant, and the related memory was
once (in the source text) called <em>a static variable</em>. Such a variable
keeps the content during the lifetime of the program and its content changes
only when it is explicitly changed by the code.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The address
is computed relatively&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;by adding the numeric offset to some base address (in
some register) of the memory subspace.  (This is done as the part of the
low-level instruction behaviour&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;no human-related programming like "take
the register content, add 5, and assign&#8230;)  Think about a function that
uses its own, local variables.  When the function is called, it gets a
block of memory big enough for storing its local variables.  The local
variable is located relatively to the beginning of the allocated block.
 The block is released when the function returns.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The memory
is allocated dynamically, during the running time via calling some function
(like <code>malloc()</code> in C) or via some other action bound to the dedicated
keyword (like <code>new</code>).  In such case, the address is known only after
the data space was created (when the program is already running), and the
address must be stored somewhere for the later reference.  No name is
bound to such memory space&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;even in compiled languages.  The size was
deduced from the prescribed type (<code>new</code>) or it was given explicitly to the
function (<code>malloc()</code>).  In the first case, the compiler keeps track
about the size derived from the type.  In the later case (<code>malloc()</code>),
a programmer is responsible for working correctly within the allocated space.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_scripting_languages">Scripting languages</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>There was a time when so called <em>scripting languages</em> appeared (think
about the Unix shell scripts or the Windows batch files).  A command
processor (say <code>bash</code> or <code>cmd</code> takes the source text called <em>a
script</em> line by line and interprets the commands written in the file.
 These languages are also called <em>interpreted</em>.  This is because
of when and how the source text is processed when the script is launched.
 There are no binary native instructions stored in the executed script
file.  The source text is read and interpreted immediately.  Of
course, the script has to be interpreted by some binary executable program--<em>the
interpreter</em>--that is capable to do the actions prescribed in the script.
 (This is done via association with the script extension or via special
command at the beginning of the script.) Because of the way how it works, the
interpreted languages are not so fast, not so powerful in comparison with
compiled languages, and also their data types are somehow more limited.
 Often, the part of a name of a variable indicates also the type.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Simply said, the work with variables is a bit magical in the scripting
languages.  You never need to know their memory address.  As you
usually write only simple scripts, you usually do not want to build more
complex data structures.  You do not care how the memory is allocated.
 (Anyway, the memory must be allocated dynamically.)</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The interpreted languages may often be <em>weakly typed</em>.  Simply said,
if the string value looks like a number, it can be treated as a number.
 Because of that, you can use such value with numeric operators, for
example.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The simpler languages often play <em>tit for tat</em>.  And we sometimes
need something in between the simple scripting languages and the extremely powerful
(fast running and expressive) compiled languages.  This can be done, and
Python is the example of such language.  Before speaking about details of
(also called) <em>dynamic languages</em>, we need to learn something more about
indirect access to memory space (i.e. to the stored values).  It is a
natural feature also in compiled languages; however, it is essential for
dynamic languages.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_pointers">Pointers</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Oh the bloody pointers!  It is the theme where many programmers with less
formal education and/or with not enough greed for knowledge fail.  When
looking at, say, C++ source code without the knowledge, many students just give
up and switch off their brain.  Possibly they have never got the
satisfactory explanation.  Let&#8217;s enhance our imagination using the following
pictures.  Let&#8217;s start the hard way&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;from the magical C++ source code to
the abstract pictures. (No problem if you do not know the C++ language.  I
will explain the necessary things.)</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Let&#8217;s start with:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>int var;
int *ptr;</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The first line declares that there will be the variable named <code>var</code> of the
type <code>int</code> (means <em>integer</em>).  The second line looks almost the
same.  There will be variable <code>ptr</code> somehow related to the type <code>int</code>.
 But what means the star?  The star changes the meaning of the
declaration of the variable.  The variable will not be of the <code>int</code>.
 It will be of the <em>pointer to int</em> type, instead.  Have a look
at the following picture:</p></div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/pointers.png" alt="Pointers." />
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The picture shows that both <code>var</code> and <code>ptr</code> variables need their memory
space.  In other words, <em>pointer variable</em> is also <em>a variable</em>.
 A pointer variable also stores a value.  The value could be called a
pointer value.  Basically, it is the address of another memory.  As
explained earlier, any variable needs memory space and the identification.
 Any pointer variable needs that much space to be able to store the
address.  If the hardware is capable to address directly say 4 GB (i.e.
2<sup>32</sup> bytes), then the variable needs 32 bits (4 bytes) of memory to store the
address.  However, if we use the 64-bit Operating System, then we say we
can (theoretically) directly address 2<sup>64</sup> bytes of memory.  I do not
believe you have that much memory in your computer.  Anyway, the pointer
variables need 8 bytes in such case.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Let&#8217;s assign the values to the variables to see how to work with pointers:</p></div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/workingWithPointers.png" alt="Working with pointers." />
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>You should already be very familiar with the fist assignment
of the <code>2</code> to the <code>var</code> variable.  The earlier picture shows that the
four bytes at the address 12 are filled with the binary representation of the
value 2.  Notice, that the variable was given the memory space at the
address 12.  The notation <code>&amp;var</code> means <em>the address of the variable</em>.
 Now, the <code>ptr</code> variable is ready to store the address.  This
way, the address 12 can be assigned to the pointer variable (see the second
line on the picture).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Having the pointer value (i.e. the address 12) inside the pointer variable that
is located on address 56 (see the picture above), we can access the memory
space of the <code>var</code> variable also indirectly, through the pointer.  To
do that, we have to read the content of the variable <code>ptr</code> located at the
address 56, and then we have to use its content (12) to locate the memory at
that address.  That&#8217;s all!  No extra magic.  Well, the syntax
may have look magically&#8230;</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The <code>*ptr</code> (with the star at in front of the name of the variable says:
take the content of the <code>ptr</code> and use it for indirect access to another part of
memory.  The process is named <em>dereferencing</em>.  The pointer
variable <em>refers</em> to some other memory, and we want to access it.  As
we have to explicitly use the star in front of the pointer variable, it is
called <em>explicit dereferencing</em>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Having the <em>access to the part of memory</em> means also the <em>write access</em>.
 The last line on the picture shows that the memory space is assigned by
new value <code>3</code>.  If you now read the variable <code>var</code>, you would get the
value 3.  The memory space belongs to the <code>var</code> variable, but from
now on it is not the only way how it can be accessed.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Does the pointer theme look so difficult to you now?  Is there anything
more to be said?  Thinking about the principle, then nothing.  But,
well, yes.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>When talking about variables in compiled languages, we have said that the
compiler converts the name to the address, deduces the size from the type of
the variable, and uses the type for static checking during the compilation.
 Is there anything about types at the last picture?  Well, yes.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The <code>*ptr = 3;</code> assigns the integer value.  The integer value can be
assigned only to an integer variable.  How the compiler knows that this
assignment is correct?  The answer is not that difficult.  It is more
difficult to spot that the check must be done by the compiler.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The <code>ptr</code> was declared as <em>pointer to int</em>.  This way, it says
that it point to the memory of the size that is capable to store the int value.
 In other words, pointers in compiled languages are usually bound with
some type.  And again, the type is used only for checking during
compilation (hence the name <em>statically typed languages</em>).  The
information about the type disappears when generating the binary executable.
 Anyway, the pointers are <em>typed</em> in the compiled languages.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>What about untyped pointers?  Are they possible?  Is it possible to
have a pointer to any type?  The short answer is yes.  The pointer
variable itself requires always the same amount of memory (4 bytes on 32-bit
OS, 8 bytes on 64-bit OS).  It simply stores the address.  The
problem is that then the compiler does not know how big is the block of memory
that is pointed to.  The pointer variable stores no knowledge about the
size of the target.  The programmer have to get the information from
somewhere else.  One of the possibilities is to store the size of the
pointed structure at the beginning of the structure.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>What else?  NULL.  Or the similar name.  This is the special
value that can be assigned a pointer variable of any type.  This means
that you can assign it also, say, to the pointer to int.  This is the only
pointer-value constant available.  It says: "the pointer points to
nowhere."  Naturally, you cannot de-reference such pointer.  The
"nowhere" can never be accessed.  If you try, the screaming
sound&#8230; kidding, not screaming actually&#8230; the error is somehow announced.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Our brain likes thinking in abstractions.  "No boring numbers,
please.  I tend to forget them."  We always solve (sub)problem
in our head first, and only then we write the idea down.  We use our
imagination.  If it is too much to keep it in our brain, we draw it on a
paper&#8230;</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Also, we need some graphical abstraction <em>to be able to share</em> what we

<div class="paragraph"><p>The memory space for the variable is usually drawn as

rectangle too.  However, we want the pointer value be more abstract.
 (Recall what the brain have said about the numbers.  Anyway, we do
not know the exact addresses and we do not care.)  The only important
thing for us is that the value points to another memory space (hence <em>the
pointer</em>).  And the pointer should be pointed, right? ;)  To
summarize, the pointer value is drawn as a fat dot with an arrow pointed to the
other memory-space rectangle.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>We also do not care how the NULL is implemented.  The only interesting
feature is that it points to nowhere.  The "electric ground"
mark is usually used.  That mark was very usual and well known to those
who worked with first computers&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;not counting Charles Babbage

<h3 id="_references">References</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The term <em>references</em> often causes confusion.  The main reason is
that it can be used in different contexts.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The more abstract point of view is based on the idea that the reference value
allows you to access some data (memory space) indirectly.  From that
abstract point of view, the plain old pointers are also references.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>However, the terms references and pointers are often discussed together, and
there are some differences emphasized between them in the case.  Usually,
the references are said to be de-referenced automatically when used (unlike the
pointers).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The confusion has roots also in the fact that different programming languages
think differently about references.  Some languages do not use the term
references, some languages do not know pointers.  Some languages do not
have any special syntax for references, and the fact of working with references
internally may be completely hidden (this is also the case of Python&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;see
later).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Back to the old compiled languages, here C++.</p></div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/references.png" alt="C++ reference." />
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The image shows the C++ syntax.  Ignore the syntactic details if you do not
know the language.  What is important, the <code>ref</code> variable must be
initialized when declared.  The reason is that it must always contain a
reference to some already existing variable, i.e. to its allocated memory
space.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Here the <code>ref</code> variable was located by the compiler/linker/loader at the
address 75 (not important).  The important is that its memory space was
filled with the address of the <code>var</code> variable immediately.  The C++
restriction is that you cannot change the reference variable later.  Any
usage of the <code>ref</code> has the same effect as using the variable <code>var</code>.</p></div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/workingWithReferences.png" alt="Working with references in C++" />
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The main difference from pointers is how the references look
in the source code.  Once the reference variable is set, you can use it <em>as
if it was another name for the pointed variable</em>.  In the example, the
reference variable is named <code>ref</code> which forces you to think this way about
it.  But imagine if it was named <code>myVar</code>.  When using a
reference variable, it looks the same as if you worked with a normal, simple
variable.  It is because the <em>automatic de-reference</em> is done (by
compiler, for you).  Anyway, the target memory space is still accessed
indirectly.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In other words, when you do not see the reference-variable declaration, you are
not able to say if you work with a simple variable or (indirectly) with another
variable.</p></div>

<h3 id="_references_for_python">References for Python</h3>

</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>We usually do not draw the references on the paper the same way as we do with
pointer-based data structures.  Anyway, we can draw them the same way when
explaining the internals.  Actually, the references are used in Python the
very same way as pointers are used in other languages.  However, it is hidden
from the programmer.  The reference value in Python (as elsewhere) needs
always the same memory space to be stored (4 bytes on 32-bit systems, 8 bytes
on 64-bit system).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>However, Python is <em>a dynamic language</em> where memory space for the objects
is always allocated in run-time, and where the name of any variable is kept
intentionally in a string form inside Python&#8217;s internal data structures.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Why to call them <em>references</em> and not <em>pointers</em>?  This is
because you will find no explicit de-referencing when working with Python.
 But that&#8217;s not all!  There is one more indirection level when
working with variables.  The topic will be discussed more in part 3.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>A side note: There is nothing like NULL value for Python references.  This
would break the concept of references.  However, there is the single
object named <code>None</code> that plays the same role.  Whenever another
object refers to <code>None</code>, it means that there is nothing more interesting
there (if the fact is not interesting on its own).</p></div>

comes first:</p></div>
<div class="olist arabic"><ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>
Everything in Python is an object. Any object has its unique <em>technical</em>
identification (the memory address).  The information about its type is
kept inside the object.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The simplest objects are few constants, numeric values, and strings.
 They are also stored as objects which means they have their own
identification.  Once they are created, they cannot change their content.
 They are <em>immutable</em>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
More-complex built-in objects are lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets.
 They contain only <em>references</em> to other objects, not the objects
itself.  Let&#8217;s call them <em>containers</em> (as it is usual also in other
languages).  The references are untyped.  The type is bound to the
target object.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Any "native" assignment in Python means assigning the reference
value.  It refers the target object that represents the assigned value. In
other words, there will be one more counted reference to the target object after
the assignment (counted by the target object).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
If any object is named, the name is stored as a key in one of the internal
Python dictionary structures. The reference to the value object is the value of
the dictionary item.

<h3 id="_values_of_objects_of_the_simple_types_can_never_be_changed">Values of objects of the simple types can never be changed!</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>When working with objects in various programming languages, it is usual to
think about the object as about a data space bound to some functionality (the
methods).  It is very usual to think about them as about
"capsules" that can change their internal state, i.e. change the
content of their internal data variables.  This is not the case of the
simple-type Python objects.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Any Python object of a simple type cannot change its value!  Once the
object was created, it stores its initial value until the object is destroyed.
 In other words, the object shown in the upper examples will always behave
as constants. <strong>The objects of the simple types represent the captured value.
 They never (logically) act as a memory space that could be reused for
different values.</strong>  In other words, having reference value to some
simple object, you can be sure that you always get the same value.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This fact may be surprising for many programmer, and it brings a whole lot of
questions.  The true beginners just do not care.  Actually, is it
that unnatural?  When working with the symbol <strong>1</strong> (one) in
mathematics, you would never expect that the same symbol changed its internal
value to 5.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>There are reasons for the "strange decisions" of the authors of
Python.  The reasons may not be immediately apparent.  One of the
reasons is that the simple-type objects are to be shared heavily, because
assigning the value means actually assigning the reference to the object.
 It will be more apparent later.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>There are also consequences of the constant nature of the objects of the simple
types.  The consequences could be quite disturbing at first.  For
example, ignoring the fact may lead to the very inefficient string processing
in the sense of time/space complexity of operations.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_built_in_containers">Built-in containers</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The more-complex built-in types of objects are lists, tuples, dictionaries, and
sets.  They are designed to <em>contain</em> other objects.  Because of
that we call them <em>containers</em> (as it is usual also in other programming
languages).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>A list allows you to store and update a sequence of other objects (the order is
preserved).  Tuple-type objecs are similar to lists, but they cannot be
modified after creation. A dictionary stores pairs <em>key, value</em> where the
key is used to access the value part (i.e. associative access; also known as a <em>map</em>
or a <em>hash table</em>).  A set allows you to capture a set of objects.
Sets can be tested, modified and otherwise manipulated using operations that
are known from the set theory (mathematics).</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>It is extremely important for understanding how Python works, that all
container objects always contain only the <em>references</em> to the objects
representing the values.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_tuples_and_lists">Tuples and lists</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Tuples came from mathematics.  They contain certain number of elements in
some order. A single tuple in Python can contain elements of more types.</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; t = (1, 'some string', 3.5)
&gt;&gt;&gt; t
(1, 'some string', 3.5)</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Now, how should we imagine the tuple object?  How it looks inside?</p></div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/05TupleExample.png" alt="Example of a tuple object." />
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Surprised? The tuple object does not contain the elements inside.  The element
objects are located outside, and they are bound to the tuple object only via
refrences.  The value part of the tuple object from the example is
actually only the array of three references.  In other words, a tuple
stores the array of references of fixed size.  It means that the tuple
object with three elements has always the same memory footprint&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;it uses the
same amount of memory independently on how big are the element objects.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>References in Python are always untyped&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;they are references to <em>any type</em>.
 This means that the element of a tuple can be the object of <em>any
type/class</em>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>There is one important thing to be mentioned.  The tuple object cannot be
changed after it was created.  This means that its value is constant.
 What does it <em>really</em> mean?  The static array of references cannot
be changed.  If the refered element objects are also constant, then the
logical value of the tuple remains the same "forever".</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>What about lists?</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; lst = [1, 'some string', 3.5]

<img src="images/06ListExample.png" alt="Example of a list object." />
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The list object is very similar to the tuple objects.
 But there is one significant difference.  The array of references
(that act as the value of the object) is a dynamic array. It can change the
number of elements.  Being capable of growing and/or shrinking, it also
means that it makes also sense to be able to change the value of the existing
references (to assign another reference value).  This means that the list
object with the given identity can change completely during its lifetime.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>So far, I tried to avoid using the variable names.  Why? It will be clear
at the end of this part.  Anyway, it is neccessary to use the variable now
for demonstration of the difference between the list and the tuple.  The <em>lst</em>
variable was assigned the list object.  The same variable can be used
later to call the <em>append()</em> method of the object.  The list object
gets one more element (it becomes bigger; see the dashed-line parts of the

<p>
not only that the tuple class does not define the <em>append()</em> method,
but there is also no other way to modify the tuple.  You can think about
the tuple object as about some <em>frozen list</em>.  The references inside
the object cannot be assigned.  Also, the array of the references cannot
grow.  There will always be three and only the three references inside, in
this case.

<div class="paragraph"><p>I know I am repeating what was said above.  But we have to be careful what
does it mean.  The same tuple can actualy represent something that
changes!  Let&#8217;s use the list as another element of the tuple.  Of
course, the list object has to be created first.  (Note: I have to use the
named variables again even though they will be explained later.  They will
be drawn as separated references with the name on the image.  From now on,
I am also going to use simplified visualization of the type information of the
objects if it is apparent.)</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The list object referenced by the <em>lst</em> variable was included as the

<div class="paragraph"><p>Ooops!  The tuple is different now!  And they say the tuple cannot be

because the references in the internal array are the same.  However, there
is no way to display symbolicaly the list object other than using its
representation.  The image explains it better:</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Notice that both the list and the tuple can be indexed (zero based) as if they
were arrays.  Now you already know why!  It comes almost for free in
the Python language, because both tuples and lists store the array of
references inside.  Indexing here means getting the reference from the
array on the index.  It is automatically dereferenced, and you have the
access to the element object.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>And yes, the identification of the integer objects from the list and from the
tuple are the same.  It means that the object is the same, identical.
 The object is shared even though there is no apparent explicit reason.
 Recall that it is one of the Python interpreter optimizations.  Then
the image should look like that:</p></div>

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The most important conclusion so far is that containers always contain references to the
objects with the value.  They do not store the value explicitly inside
itself.  The "strange behaviour" usually means that the person
who complains is not aware of the usage of references instead of target-object
values.  Once you know that, you also know the positive consequences.
 Working with the container of certain size take the same time
independently on how complex are the element objects.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_sets">Sets</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The documentation says: "A <em>set</em> object is an unordered collection of
distinct <em>hashable</em> objects."  Unlike a tuple of a list object,
a set object does not capture the order of collected elements.  Try the
following:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; mySet = set([1, 'some string', 3.5])
&gt;&gt;&gt; mySet
set(['some string', 1, 3.5])</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Well, the strange syntax&#8230; The set type was added in Python version 2.4, which
means quite late.  Actually, the above code does not use any special
syntax.  You can even (re)define the <em>class set</em> that would be used
the same way.  As we need to pass some initial elements when the object is
created, we need some other container that contains them.  The authors of
Python prefer a list.  However, you can pass also other iterable objects.
 Try it with the tuple:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; set( (1, 'some string', 3.5) )
set(['some string', 1, 3.5])</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>As for other types, if possible, the representation of the object has the form
that could be copy/pasted to a source file to get the object with the same
content.  Even though we passed a tuple, the representation shows the list
as the argument.  This is because there is no captured knowledge what was
passed to the constructor.  Notice also that the order of the elements in
the sequence has changed.  This is because the set object does not caputre
the initial order of elements either.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Newer versions of Python support also the new syntax for creation of a set
object it uses curly braces&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;as usual in mathematics.  There is one
exception.  The empty set cannot be expressed as <code>{}</code> because it is
already used for empty dictionary object.  We must use <code>set()</code> or <code>set([])</code>
instead:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; {1, 'some string', 3.5}
set([3.5, 'some string', 1])
&gt;&gt;&gt; set()
set([])
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(set())
&lt;type 'set'&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; {}
{}
&gt;&gt;&gt; type({})
&lt;type 'dict'&gt;</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>"OK! Now I know how Python set work internally!"  Well, there
are some kinks that you would not expect.  You may want to create the set
like this:</p></div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/09SetObjectExampleKink.png" alt="The set object can be kinky ;)" />
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>"No problem!"</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; set([1, 'some string', 3.5, True])
set(['some string', 1, 3.5])</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>"Oops! Where is my <strong>True</strong>?"  Well, this may be quite
surprising.  To explain that behaviour, we have to talk about hash values.
 Probably the simplest way to demonstrate is to use the built-in function
named&#8230;</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_hash">hash()</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The <em>hash(arg)</em> built-in function returns so called <em>hash value</em> of the
passed argument.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Where the name <em>hash</em> came from&#8230; Do you now that food made of chopped
meat?  Even when the resul looks differently than the raw meat, you can
still guess that it was made of meat.  When you chop some vegetables, the
result will look differently.  But if you chop another portion of the same
kind of meat, the sample will look the same as the other meat sample.  You
can take only small amount of the result of chopping, and you can still guess
if it belongs to the chopped meat or to the chopped vegetable.  You can
decide using the small sample, even though the samples differ from the
originals.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The <em>hash()</em> function does the same with the object passed as the
argument.  The sample has the form of an integer number.  When you
get the same number, the source was somehow ekvivalent. Try:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; hash(1)
1
&gt;&gt;&gt; hash('some string')
-604248944
&gt;&gt;&gt; hash(3.5)
1879113728</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>You can see that it always return some integer value.  However, not every
object is <em>hashable</em>.  Try:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; hash([1, 2, 3])
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In this case, the list is not hashable because it can change its content.
 This means that the next time the object would return a different hash
number.  Because of this, the concrete hash number cannot always represent
the content of the content of the list object.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>I will use the small square with a distinct colour to show the value of the
hash of the object.</p></div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/10hashAsColour.png" alt="Illustration of hash values." />
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Now back to the set type.  The set always contains one value only once.
 In other words, it contains unique values.  On the other hand, the
set in Python can be used as a container for objects of different types.
 We need some general mean to decide whether the object is inside the set
or not.  Here comes the hash value of the object.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>When testing whether the object is inside the set or not, we calculate <em>hash(obj)</em>
first.  Then we can check, whether the object with the same hash value is
inside.  The hash function has also one important feature.  It can be
easily transformed to the index of an array element.  When being lucky,
the element contains information about the object with the same hash value.
 When being not so lucky, there is a conflict (two hash values converted
to the same index).  The conflict must be resolved by some additional
mechanism.  You can find the reference to more detailed article below in
the section describing dictionaries.  The internal array must be bigger
than the number of elements to minimize the conflicts.</p></div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/11SetHashAndUniqueness.png" alt="A set" />
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>However, there is one kink with Python hash values.  Sometimes, different objects
may have the same hash value:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; hash(1)
1
&gt;&gt;&gt; hash(1.0)
1
&gt;&gt;&gt; hash(1+0j)
1
&gt;&gt;&gt; hash(True)
1</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/12sameHash.png" alt="Objects with the same hash value." />
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This is the reason, why the <em>True</em>
was not inserted into the set in the earlier example.  When searching for
the index in the internal array, the hash value of the True object was already
found at the index.  The insertion algorithm decides only based on the
hash value, even though the object present in the set represents the <em>1</em>
(of the integer type).  Because of that simplification, Python interpreter
decided not to insert <em>object with the same value</em> again. There are always
some tradeoffs when you look deep enough.  Everywhere.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>A final note related to hashability.  An object of the same type can be
sometimes hashable and sometimes not.  For example a tuple object:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; type( (1, 'some string', 3.5) )
&lt;type 'tuple'&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; hash( (1, 'some string', 3.5) )
1562160248
&gt;&gt;&gt; type( (1, 'some string', 3.5, []) )
&lt;type 'tuple'&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; hash( (1, 'some string', 3.5, []) )
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If the tuple contains only hashable items, then the whole tuple is hashable.
This means that we can get the number that can be used as a signature of
the object.  However, when the tuple contains a list, it is not hashable
any more.  This is because the content of the list object can be modified,
and there is no fixed number that could represent the tuple content.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_mutable_and_immutable_8230_what_does_it_mean">Mutable and immutable&#8230; What does it mean?</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>When reading the Python documentation or articles, you will definitely find the
terms <em>mutable</em> or <em>immutable</em>.  Fancy words, simple meaning.
 A mutable object can be changed (its content) during lifetime.  An
immutable object cannot change its content after it was created.  In other
words, immutable means <em>with the constant content</em>, mutable means <em>with
the content that can be modified</em>.  But remember, that the content of
the container is the array of references.  If the container is immutable
(e.g. of the tuple type), then only the references are constant.  Some or
all of the refered objects may still be mutable.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>So, what are the immutable types that we have mentioned so far?  All
simple built-in types are immutable: integer, float, complex, string.  The
tuple type is immutable.  There is also the immutable version of the set
type.  The type is called <em>frozenset</em>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Why so much about hashability and mutability?  We will use that term
later.  There is one type heavily used in Python as another type that is
based on hashing.  The type is named <em>dict</em>.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_dictionaries">Dictionaries</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Dictionary type is one of the major data types in Python.  It must be
implemented very efficiently not only because <em>you</em> want to use it, but
also because the Python interpreter uses it even when you are not looking.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>What the doc says about the dictionary type&#8230;</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>A <em>mapping</em> object maps hashable values to arbitrary
objects. Mappings are mutable objects. There is currently only one standard
mapping type, the dictionary. [&#8230;]</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>A dictionary’s keys are almost arbitrary values. Values that are not hashable
[&#8230;] may not be used as keys. Numeric types used for keys obey the normal
rules for numeric comparison: if two numbers compare equal (such as 1 and 1.0)
then they can be used interchangeably to index the same dictionary entry.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>As for the mentioned numeric types for keys, we already know
why it is so.  This is because the hash value of the keys plays the role
when accessing the items of a dictionary.  If you understand the above <em>set</em>
type, it will not be difficult to understand the <em>dict</em> type for you.</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; dict()
{}
&gt;&gt;&gt; {}
{}
&gt;&gt;&gt; type({})
&lt;type 'dict'&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(dict())
&lt;type 'dict'&gt;</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>A dictionary object can be created the same way as any other object&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;via
calling the class name as if it were a function (see the <em>dict()</em>).
(You may prefer to name this as "using the class constructor",
but there area some differences in Python, and it does not define the term <em>constructor</em>
explicitly.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>However, there is also a special syntax for creating a dictionary object in
Python.  It uses curly braces.  Using empty curly braces mean
creating an empty dictionary.  (A side note: This works in Python from
early days.  Do you remember the new syntax for creating the set objects?
 Here is the reason why the empty set cannot be created this way.)</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Usually, dictionary objects are created and initialized using the special
syntax with curly braces.  In some cases, we need to prescribe the content
of the dictionary explicitly in the source code.</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; {'a': 1, 'bb': 'some string', 5: 3.5, 'xxx': True}
{'a': 1, 'xxx': True, 5: 3.5, 'bb': 'some string'}</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Notice that the representation of the just created dictionary has the same
form.  Notice where the spaces are placed and where they are not.
 This may be a minor issue.  Still, keeping the style helps to make
your programs more readable.  If you get used to, you will also more easily
swallow the sources written by the others.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Notice also, that the representation of the above dictionary content shows the
items in a different order.  The reason is the same as in the set type.
 A dictionary organizes the items inside differently than say a list type.
 There is no way to get the original order.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Sometimes we get data from other sources in another form, and we want to fill
the dictionary with them.  The following example show the list of tuples
that is used for initialization:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; dict([('a', 1), ('bb', 'some string'), (5, 3.5), ('xxx', True)])
{'a': 1, 'xxx': True, 5: 3.5, 'bb': 'some string'}</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The <em>dict()</em> constructor is capable to consume whatever sequence of
tuples.  This means that it can be a tuple of tuples instead of the list
of tuples.  It can also be set of tuples.  The rule is that the
dictionary initialize have to be able iterate through the items and then the
item must contain two ordered elements&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;the key and the value:</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; dict( (('a', 1), ('bb', 'some string'), (5, 3.5), ('xxx', True)) )
{'a': 1, 'xxx': True, 5: 3.5, 'bb': 'some string'}</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Notice a kind of strange example that shows a tuple of strings with two
characters.  It also meets the rules.  The two-char string is split
to two chars.  The first one is used as the key, the other as the value.
 (But this is purely for illustration of how it works.  Do not search
for any meaningful usage of the case.)</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; dict( ('aA', 'bB', 'cC') )
{'a': 'A', 'c': 'C', 'b': 'B'}</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>A dictionary works as an associative array.  Therefore the syntax directly
reflects the idea.  You can use a key value as if it was an index.
 You can read the existing value, and you can assign both the existing
item (i.e. modification) or the new item (i.e. creation).  We can also
delete an element using the <em>del</em> statement.  (We need the variable
name for that.  The variables will be explained a bit later, as said
earlier.)</p></div>

<h3 id="_variables_2">Variables</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Now it comes.  What really are the variables in Python?  Variables in
Python are named references.  The name is stored in memory during runtime.
 It is not lost during compilation as in classical compiled languages.
 A Python variable has no type associated to the name (unlike in compiled
languages).  This is because a Python variable stores always the same type
of value.  It stores a reference to the target object.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>And how the names and the references are bound together.  You may have
already guessed.  The variable names are keys to a hidden dictionary (used
by the Python interpreter for the purpose).  The references to the targets
are at the value side of that dictionary.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Actually, the hidden dictionaries are not that hidden.  There are
functions that gives you the access to the dictionaries.  One of them is
the built-in function named <em>globals()</em>.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>There are some restictions for identifiers in any programming language. They
usually must be compound of letters, numerals, and some special characters
(e.g. undercore).  To make it short, the keys in the hidden dictionary
must be of the string type.</p></div>

<h3 id="_assignment_operation">Assignment operation</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Now it should be clear that the assignment to a variable means that the string
form of its name is or found in the appropriate internal dictionary as a key,
or the item for the key is created.  The assigned value is always some
object.  The reference to the object is used as the value part of the
dictionary.</p></div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_more_variables">More variables</h3>
<div class="paragraph"><p>What about the dirty idea to create dynamically a variable that was not given
its identifier in the source code.  Say, its name could be dynamically
created, read from a text file or whatever.  Here we simulate it by
assigning the <em>s</em> variable.</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; s = 'myVariable'
&gt;&gt;&gt; g[s] = 12345
&gt;&gt;&gt; g

 'd': {'a': 1, 'xxx': True, 5: 3.5, 'bb': 'some string'},
 'var3': False,
 'var2': 'whatever string',

 '__name__': '__main__',
 '__doc__': None}</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>See, the <em>myVariable</em> with the content 12345 is there!  Can we use
the newly created variable name as if it was defined in the source text?</p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; myVariable
12345</code></pre>
</div></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>It works!  Notice that it is very different in programming languages to
write an identifier and write a string literal with the same name inside.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Warning: the <em>globals()</em> name suggests that it stores global variables.
 However, the dictionary stores only top-level variables <em>inside a
module</em>.  There is that many of such dictionaries, how many modules is
used in your program.  There also is the built-in <em>locals()</em> function
that returns the dictionary of local variables.  However, you should never
modify it.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The above illustration shows how variables are implemented in Python.
 However, it looks quite complex on its own.  To simplify the
illustration of used variables, I will use pictures like the following.
 It illustrates the same case&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;except the <em>g</em> variable.</p></div>

implemented somehow differently?</p></div>

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>I hope it is the "Aha!" moment for you.  The key difference is
that the list objects are mutable.  This means that the <em>.append()</em>
method is able to modify the same object.  However, strings are immutable.
 The concatenation operator (+) cannot modify the original string object.
 The string object with the value <em>' extended'</em> must be created
first, then the + operator puts the values of the two strings together and
creates another string object.  Only after that the <em>s2</em> variable is
assigned the reference to the newly created object.  Therefore the <em>s1</em>
and <em>s2</em> cannot point to the same object.  (The string object with
the value <em>' extended'</em> exists only temporarily.  It is not
referenced later, and it will be destroyed by the garbage collector.)</p></div>
